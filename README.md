# Problem Statement

MHT-CET is an Engineering entrance in Maharashtra. Our website will help students to prepare. Mostly mock tests available in market are paid, we have created free mock test for such poor and brilliant students.

# Project Description

We have created a Website to help students prepare for Maharashtra's Engineering Entrance (MHT-CET). Our website has syllabus, top colleges list as well as previous cut-offs and most interesting highlighting feature is mock test. This mock test is designed using previous years questions, you'll be able to see score instantly after submitting. We have bot in contacts page which will help you and you can give feedback too via contact page. For bot we have used Azure bot service. And I have hosted this website on Azure Static Web Apps.
